### Project Description
This project explores the development and application of a novel data architecture
for predicting ambient temperatures across US cities, focusing on integrating
multi-source data i.e. ECOSTRESS land surface temperatures, urban surface properties,
and crowdsourced weather data. The methodology is designed for scalability and
adaptability across different urban regions, employing rigorous data quality control
to enhance prediction accuracy. 

The validation of this model across diverse urban
settings, demonstrated through rigorous RMSE comparisons and spatial mapping,
validates its superiority over traditional models, hence beating benchmark models, with an average **RMSE of 0.8 degrees at 70 metre resolution**, which is the best result in this domain.

Through experiments in diverse climatic conditions in Madison, Wisconsin, and Las Vegas, Nevada, the study assesses
the modelâ€™s generalizability and effectiveness in capturing spatio-temporal temperature variations.

Data Extraction Pipeline:
1) Wunderground data <br>
    a) PWS/Observation Stations/Airport<br>
        1) Get the station lists : <br>
            1) Update wunder_config.ini for API_KEY and lat long ranges.<br>
            2) Go to /Orlando/ and run "python list_weather_stations.py [pws/observation/airport]". It will save corresponding file in  data/Orlando/. <br>

            This saves a list of stations in data/Orlando/<pws>_station_lists_<orlando>.csv.<br>


        2) Download the corresponding data: <br>
            Scripts used : pws_script.py for pws data, observation_script.py for observation_data and parallel.py.
            Usage : 
    
            2.1) python parallel.py pws 
            This uses the pws_script.py , which collects data on a daily basis and hence takes time.

            2.2) python parallel_obs.py, 
                which collects data from observation_script.py in monthly basis and is hence faster.

    Known Issues : You may need to go to wunderground and generate new "API KEY" time and again

    b) 
    
    
2) Netatmos Data

3) LTER Data
